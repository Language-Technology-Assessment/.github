## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
The language technology assessment group is based at Radboud University in Nijmegen, The Netherlands. We conduct technology assessment research on interactive interfaces and generative AI systems.

Our current focus is the [European Open Source AI Index](https://www.osai-index.eu/ "European Open Source AI Index"). The index is populated from the [main database](https://github.com/Language-Technology-Assessment/main-database). Website content â€”guides, blog posts and the likeâ€” are mainted through [the OSAI repo](https://github.com/Language-Technology-Assessment/European-open-AI-index). 

[Contributions welcome](https://www.osai-index.eu/contribute)!
